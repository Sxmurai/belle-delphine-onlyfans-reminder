# READ BEFORE USING

There is some pretty important things in here, which you NEED to see if you want to use it. Otherwise, you'll find the app to do some weird things.

# belle-delphine-onlyfans-reminder
A android app made to annoy you about Belle Delphine's *ahem* she's uploading on her OnlyFans on christmas day.

---

## Why?

Well, I was in a DM call with someone via discord and I saw in their screenshare that they brought up Belle Delphine onlyfans porno she's uploading on the 25th of December. So I decided it would be a GREAT idea to make an android app to annoy you about it, on christmas day.

The app does the following:

- Sends a notification to your phone on the 25th telling you to check her onlyfans
- Vibrates until you force quit the app (you **need** to force quit it or else it won't stop)

The app does **not** have a UI interface, it only does the things above.

It goes off at about 8:30AM (or PM, idfk), so it won't wake you up at midnight on christmas.

## Installing

There is no install process, it's not even on the app store lmfao. I made it for fun, and that's all it should be.
